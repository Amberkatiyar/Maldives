    <p>For our worldly guests, a stay at Anantara is just one more chapter in a lifetime of travel and exploration. And we intend to make it an extraordinary one.
        <br>
    Our thoughtfully designed luxury hotels and resorts provide windows into the genuine modern character of each destination. Inside and outside each property, travellers engage with the places, people and stories that make the destination like nowhere else in the world. 
        <br>
        The Anantara experience was born in 2001 with our first luxury property in Thailandâ€™s historic seaside retreat of Hua Hin. From that day forward, we expanded throughout the world to cosmopolitan cities, lush islands, desert sands, heritage destinations, uncharted beaches and contemporary resort destinations.
