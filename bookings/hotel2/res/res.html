    <p>LUX* Resorts & Hotels is a major luxury hotel operator based in Mauritius which owns or part-owns many of its hotels and runs others under management contracts, which typically involve, in addition to management services, design, operations, sales and marketing. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of LUX Hospitality Ltd. which is listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius and is an affiliate member of GML, the countryâ€™s largest conglomerate as of 2014. Most LUX properties are beachfront hotels. LUX Belle Mare is located on the East Coast, LUX Le Morne on the West Coast and LUX Grand Gaube in the North. All three are rated five star although the government is currently thinking of introducing a revised system.
